### Example scripts for pre-train and finetuning 
These scripts run a recommended config for GPT, LLAMA2, Nemotron pretraining, and finetuning for various model sizes on A100, H100. For example, for GPT3 pretrain the following folders provide sample scripts.

- [a100](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher/tree/master/examples/training/gpt/a100)
: Scripts to run GPT pretraining on NVIDIA A100, in bf16 data type

- [h100](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher/tree/master/examples/training/gpt/h100)
: Scripts to run GPT pretraining for NVIDIA H100, in fp8 data type

#### Setup
1. To run these scripts, you must have access to the nemo container (https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo)
     - Please sign in at [NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com/signin) (user = ea-bignlp/ga-participants) to access the catalog.
       
2. Update the following bash variables in the example run scripts:
     - ``` NEMO_MEGATRON_LAUNCHER_DIR ``` : the directory of where this repository is located

     - ``` DATA_DIR ``` : the directory of the dataset used for pretraining, by default this is ``` NEMO_MEGATRON_LAUNCHER_DIR/data ```

3. Enter your cluster enviroment settings at 
  [config.yaml](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher/blob/master/launcher_scripts/conf/config.yaml)
    
    For bcm type clusters update the job name, partition, and account at [bcm.yaml]( https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher/blob/master/launcher_scripts/conf/cluster/bcm.yaml)

4. For testing performance with synthetic data on an interactive node, you need to add the following options to your bash script:
    ```
            cluster_type=interactive \
            ++training.cluster_type=BCP \
            training.model.data.data_impl="mock" \
            training.model.data.data_prefix=[]
    ```
    
For further details see [General Configuration](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/modelguide/usingautoconfigurator.html#general-configuration) 

#### Results
For performance, the "step_time_per_sec" variable on the console out provides a quick way to read performance of a workload.

For more details and graphics, one can use tensorboard or Weights and Biases. In order to use that, please use results stored at ``` NEMO_MEGATRON_LAUNCHER_DIR/results/<experiment_name> ``` with the following structure:

- ``` NEMO_MEGATRON_LAUNCHER_DIR/results/<experiment_name>/<experiment_name>.yaml ``` : The config of the pretrained model
- ``` NEMO_MEGATRON_LAUNCHER_DIR/results/<experiment_name>/<jobname>_<experiment_name>.sh ``` : The autogenerated .sh file that was run
- ``` NEMO_MEGATRON_LAUNCHER_DIR/results/<experiment_name>/results/ ``` : Directory contained per rank logs, and tensorboard data.

For further details see [Interpreting the Results](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/modelguide/usingautoconfigurator.html#interpreting-the-results)
