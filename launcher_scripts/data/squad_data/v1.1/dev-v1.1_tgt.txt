5,500,000 square kilometres (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest.
This region includes territory belonging to nine nations.
States or departments in four nations contain "Amazonas" in their names.

the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent.
Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics.
During the Oligocene, for example, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band.
It expanded again during the Middle Miocene, then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum.
However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.

Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching

This concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth
Davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in Europe

Donald Davies
packet switching
suggested it for use in the ARPANET
each packet includes complete addressing information
individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery
Each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers. It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet
the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet sequence number
The packet header can be small, as it only needs to contain this code and any information, such as length, timestamp, or sequence number
Routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table
a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking
a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication
connection-oriented operations. But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer
supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching
Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted
A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS

In the virtual call system, the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host

private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network
There were two kinds of X.25 networks. Some such as DATAPAC and TRANSPAC
DATAPAC was developed by Bell Northern Research
A user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the DNIC of the remote network as part of the destination address
AUSTPAC was an Australian public X.25 network operated by Telstra
supporting applications such as on-line betting, financial applications
Access can be via a dial-up terminal to a PAD, or, by linking a permanent X.25 node to the network

Mitochondria
two
infected cells seal themselves off and undergo programmed cell death
infected cells release signals warning the rest of the plant of a pathogen's presence
by purposely damaging their photosynthetic system
reactive oxygen species
salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species
After detecting stress in a cell
pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule
signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus
photosynthesis
photosynthesis
food in the form of sugars
Water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2)
sugar and oxygen (O2)
generate ATP energy
into the thylakoid space
up to a thousand times
phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate
adenosine triphosphate
NADP+
cyclic photophosphorylation
in C4 plants
more ATP than NADPH
The Calvin cycle
unstable six-carbon molecules that immediately break down
three-carbon molecules called 3-phosphoglyceric acid
one out of every six
glucose monomers in the chloroplast can be linked together
Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations
distorting the grana and thylakoids
Waterlogged roots
another photosynthesis-depressing factor
add O2 instead of CO2 to RuBP
when the oxygen concentration is too high
it consumes ATP and oxygen, releases CO2, and produces no sugar
up to half the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle
they exhibit a distinct chloroplast dimorphism
in their stroma
cysteine and methionine
it has trouble crossing membranes to get to where it is needed
whether the organelle carries out the last leg of the pathway or if it happens in the cytosol
Chloroplasts
undifferentiated proplastids found in the zygote, or fertilized egg
in an adult plant's apical meristems
the formation of starch-storing amyloplasts
proplastids may develop into an etioplast stage before becoming chloroplasts
a plastid that lacks chlorophyll
invaginations that form a lattice of tubes in their stroma
a yellow chlorophyll precursor
Gymnosperms
chromoplasts
pigment-filled plastids responsible for the bright colors seen in flowers and ripe fruit
