Whitehead advocated teaching a relatively few important concepts
important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge, discovering their application in actual life
For Whitehead, education should be the exact opposite of the multidisciplinary, value-free school model
it should be transdisciplinary, and laden with values and general principles that provide students with a bedrock of wisdom

he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education

By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete

each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago
Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things
The idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space, and not necessarily related to anything
in Whitehead's view, relations take a primary role, perhaps even more important than the relata themselves
It sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects.
it obscures the importance of relations

in some sense nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities – its synthesis of and reaction to the world around it
A real thing is just that which forces the rest of the universe to in some way conform to it
if theoretically a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity (i.e. it was not related to any other entity), it could not be said to really exist
Relations are not secondary to what a thing is, they are what the thing is.

It is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved.

Whitehead thus sees God and the world as fulfilling one another
He sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only God can provide
by taking them into God's self, thereafter changing God and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time
individual
"religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness ... and if you are never solitary, you are never religious."
a system of general truths that transformed a person's character
while religion is often a good influence, it is not necessarily good
solitariness
"the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals."
meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone, but only in the context of the universal community
The spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself
the individual and universal/social aspects of religion are mutually dependent
through the work of his students and admirers rather
Bruno Latour
Claremont and a select number of liberal graduate-level theology and philosophy programs
Bertrand Russell, and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of Willard Van Orman Quine
"he stands provisionally as the last great Anglo-American philosopher before Wittgenstein's disciples spread their misty confusion, sufficiency, and terror."
American progressive theology

John B. Cobb, Jr., David Ray Griffin, Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki, C. Robert Mesle, Roland Faber, and Catherine Keller
God's relational nature
"the fellow sufferer who understands", and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events
people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers – so why would this be a praise-worthy quality in God?
as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world
"process naturalism", i.e. a process theology without God.
biology and economics
poststructuralist, postcolonialist, and feminist theory
geneticist
Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist
process theologians are so diverse and transdisciplinary in their views and interests
"an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of emotion that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone."
religion takes deeply felt emotions and contextualizes them within a system of general truths about the world
a kind of bridge between philosophy and the emotions and purposes of a particular society
It is the task of religion to make philosophy applicable to the everyday lives of ordinary people.
pioneer in the fields of organizational theory and organizational behavior
ontology that "understands becoming as a relational process; difference as being related, yet unique; and the purpose of becoming as harmonizing difference."

Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (or the Gates Foundation, abbreviated as BMGF) is the largest private foundation in the world
The foundation, based in Seattle, Washington
Warren Buffett (then the world's richest person, estimated worth of US$62 billion as of April 16, 2008)
pledged to give the foundation approximately 10 million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares
In July 2013, Buffet announced another donation of his company's Class B, this time in the amount worth $2 billion
In November 2014, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced that they are adopting an open access (OA) policy for publications and data
open access (OA) policy for publications and data, "to enable the unrestricted access and reuse of all peer-reviewed published research funded by the foundation
As of January 1, 2015 their Open Access policy is effective for all new agreements.
trustees divided the organization into two entities: the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (foundation) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust
The foundation section, based in Seattle, US, "focuses on improving health and alleviating extreme poverty
The trust section manages "the investment assets and transfer proceeds to the foundation as necessary to achieve the foundation's charitable goals
it holds the assets of Bill and Melinda Gates, who are the sole trustees, and receives contributions from Buffett
The foundation trust invests undistributed assets
exclusive goal of maximizing the return on investment
its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries
These include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world
the foundation announced in 2007 a review of its investments to assess social responsibility. It subsequently cancelled the review
n March 2006, the foundation announced a US$5 million grant for the International Justice Mission (IJM)
a human rights organization based in Washington, D.C., US to work in the area of sex trafficking.
the grant would allow the IJM to "create a replicable model for combating sex trafficking and slavery
conducting undercover investigations, training law enforcement, rescuing victims, ensuring appropriate aftercare, and seeking perpetrator accountability".
The IJM used the grant money to found "Project Lantern
"Project Lantern" and established an office in the Philippines city of Cebu.
IJM stated that Project Lantern had led to "an increase in law enforcement activity in sex trafficking cases
increase in services – like shelter, counseling and career training – provided to trafficking survivors"
the IJM was exploring opportunities to replicate the model in other regions.
The Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WSH) program of the Gates Foundation was launched in mid-2005
and became a full-fledged program under the Global Development Division in early 2010
since 2005 undertaken a wide range of efforts in the WASH sector involving research, experimentation, reflection, advocacy, and field implementation
In 2009, the Foundation decided to refocus its WASH effort mainly on sustainable sanitation services for the poor, using non-piped sanitation services
This was because the sanitation sector was generally receiving less attention from other donors and from governments
Their grant-making focus has been since 2011 on sanitation science and technology ("transformative technologies")
delivery models at scale, urban sanitation markets, building demand for sanitation, measurement and evaluation as well as policy, advocacy and communications
funding now focuses primarily on sanitation, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, because access to improved sanitation is lowest in those regions
In mid 2011, the Foundation announced in its new "Water, Sanitation, Hygiene Strategy Overview"
Improved sanitation in the developing world is a global need
Improved sanitation in the developing world is a global need, but a neglected priority as shown by the data collected
About one billion people have no sanitation facility whatsoever and continue to defecate in gutters, behind bushes or in open water bodies
India is the country with the highest number of people practicing open defecation: around 600 million people
"Reinvent the Toilet Fair" in Delhi, India in March 2014.
In 2011, the foundation launched a program called "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge
to promote the development of innovations in toilet design to benefit the 2.5 billion people that do not have access to safe and effective sanitation
It was complemented by a program called "Grand Challenges Explorations" (2011 to 2013 with some follow-up grants reaching until 2015)
Both funding schemes explicitly excluded project ideas that relied on centralized sewerage systems or are not compatible with development country contexts
universities in the U.S., Europe, India, China and South Africa, have received grants to develop innovative on-site and off-site waste treatment solutions
The grants were in the order of 400,000 USD for their first phase, followed by typically 1-3 million USD for their second phase
many of them investigated resource recovery or processing technologies for excreta or fecal sludge.
The Reinvent the Toilet Challenge is a long-term research and development effort to develop a hygienic, stand-alone toilet
This challenge is being complemented by another investment program to develop new technologies for improved pit latrine emptying
The aim of the "Omni Processor" is to convert excreta (for example fecal sludge) into beneficial products such as energy and soil nutrients
The foundation has donated billions of dollars to help sufferers of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria
protecting millions of children from death at the hands of preventable diseases
Gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained, higher-paid clinicians, diverting staff from basic care" in sub-Saharan Africa
"the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation
discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations cannot prevent".
has decided not to fund abortion"
the emotional and personal debate about abortion is threatening to get in the way of the lifesaving consensus regarding basic family planning
Up to 2013, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided $71 million to Planned Parenthood
U.S. Libraries initiative with a goal of "ensuring that if you can get to a public library, you can reach the internet
Only 35% of the world's population has access to the Internet
The foundation has given grants, installed computers and software, and provided training and technical support in partnership with public libraries nationwide
this foundation helps move public libraries into the digital age.
A key aspect of the Gates Foundation's U.S. efforts involves an overhaul of the country's education policies at both the K-12 and college levels
including support for teacher evaluations and charter schools and opposition to seniority-based layoffs
It spent $373 million on education in 2009.
The foundation was the biggest early backer of the Common Core State Standards Initiative.
One of the foundation's goals is to lower poverty by increasing the number of college graduates in the United States
One of the ways the foundation has sought to increase the number of college graduates is to get them through college faster
Reimagining Aid Design and Delivery" grants to think tanks and advocacy organizations
As part of its education-related initiatives, the foundation has funded journalists, think tanks, lobbying organizations and governments
Millions of dollars of grants to news organizations have funded reporting on education and higher education
critics have feared the foundation for directing the conversation on education or pushing its point of view through news coverage
the foundation has said it lists all its grants publicly
Teach Plus, which was founded by new teachers and advocates against seniority-based layoffs
they may marginalize researchers who do not support Gates' predetermined policy preferences
Several Gates-backed policies such as small schools, charter schools, and increasing class sizes
but some studies indicate they have not improved educational outcomes and may have caused harm
Peer reviewed scientific studies at Stanford find that Charter Schools do not systematically improve student performance
the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, which manages the endowment assets and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
spend all of [the Trust's] resources within 20 years after Bill's and Melinda's deaths
the proceeds from the Berkshire Hathaway shares he still owns at death are to be used for philanthropic purposes within 10 years

A bantam is a small variety of domestic chicken, either a miniature version of a member of a standard breed, or a "true bantam" with no larger counterpart
Bantams may be a quarter to a third of the size of standard birds and lay similarly small eggs

By 1940, the quail egg industry was flourishing,
the events of World War II led to the complete loss of quail lines bred for their song type, as well as almost all of those bred for egg production
Modern birds can lay upward of 300 eggs a year
Japanese quail are also used in biomedical research in fields such as genetics, embryology, nutrition, physiology, pathology, and toxicity studies

Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat in the world, accounting for about 30% of total meat production worldwide
Sixteen billion birds are raised annually
more than half of these in industrialised, factory-like production units
There are two distinct models of production;
the European Union supply chain model seeks to supply products which can be traced back to the farm of origin
China producing two thirds of the total, some 1.7 billion birds
Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia and South Korea (12% in total)
France (3.5%) is the largest producer in the West,
94% share
The meatiest parts of a bird are the flight muscles on its chest, called "breast" meat, and the walking muscles on the legs, called the "thigh" and "drumstick"
wings are also eaten (Buffalo wings are a popular example in the United States) and may be split into three segments,
fresh or frozen, as whole birds or as joints (cuts), bone-in or deboned, seasoned in various ways, raw or ready cooked.
The dark colour comes from the protein myoglobin, which plays a key role in oxygen uptake and storage within cells
White muscle, in contrast, is suitable only for short bursts of activity such as, for chickens, flying
the microscopic regular structure of intracellular muscle fibrils which can diffract light and produce iridescent colours
birds with breast muscle more suitable for sustained flight, such as ducks and geese, have red muscle (and therefore dark meat) throughout

Thorough cooking of the product would kill these bacteria,
a risk of cross-contamination from improper handling of the raw product is still present
people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus
areas such as Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected
The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.

later as a sideshow exhibition in North American traveling carnivals and vaudeville halls

This public reveal has garnered mixed reactions from the wrestling community
many U.S. states still regulate professional wrestling as they do other professional competitive sports
The audience is recognized and acknowledged by the performers as spectators
This leads to a high level of audience participation
their reactions can dictate how the performance unfolds.
Often, individual matches will be part of a longer storyline conflict between "babyfaces" (often shortened to just "faces") and "heels".
"heels" (the "bad guys")
the first side to achieve the majority number of pinfalls, submissions, or countouts being the winner.
Historically, matches were wrestled to 3 falls ("best 2 out of 3") or 5 falls ("best 3 out of 5").
The standard for modern matches is one fall.
if not enough falls are scored by the end of the time limit, the match is declared a draw.

The most common of these is the ladder match
In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring.
the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team.

20-30 wrestlers
their actions are also frequently scripted for dramatic effect
The most basic rule is that an action must be seen by a referee to be declared for a fall or disqualification.
Most referees are unnamed and essentially anonymous, though the WWE has let their officials reveal their names.

Special guest referees may be used from time to time;
often scripted to dispense with the appearance of neutrality and use their influence to unfairly influence the outcome of the match for added dramatic impact. F
They also have the power to eject from ringside any of the heel wrestler's entourage/stable, who may otherwise interfere with the match.

four wrestlers, each for themselves, fight in a match, but only two wrestlers can be in the match at any given time.
tags can be made between any two wrestlers.
four-corner match
this is done to give wrestlers a break from the action
any time that a wrestler's shoulders are down (both shoulders touching the mat), back-first and any part of the opponent's body is lying over the wrestler.
a cocky wrestler may place their foot gently on the opponent's body, prompting a three-count from the referee.

inhabitation in the region of Utrecht, dating back to the Stone Age (app. 2200 BCE)
Claudius decided the empire should not expand north.
To consolidate the border the limes Germanicus defense line was constructed  along the main branch of the river Rhine
These fortresses were designed to house a cohort of about 500 Roman soldiers
Near the fort settlements would grow housing artisans, traders and soldiers' wives and children
Germanic tribes regularly invaded the Roman territories.
Around 275 the Romans could no longer maintain the northern border and Utrecht was abandoned
Little is known about the next period 270–650.
a church was built within the walls of the Roman fortress
In ongoing border conflicts with the Frisians this first church was destroyed.
English and Irish missionaries set out to convert the Frisians
The pope appointed their leader, Willibrordus, bishop of the Frisians
Frankish leader Charles Martel bestowed the fortress in Utrecht and the surrounding lands as the base of the bishops
After the fall of Dorestad around 850, Utrecht became one of the most important cities in the Netherlands
Utrecht as a centre of Christianity is illustrated by the election of the Utrecht-born Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens as pope in 1522
the Bishops of Utrecht came to exercise worldly power as prince-bishops
not only included the modern province of Utrecht (Nedersticht, 'lower Sticht'), but also extended to the northeast
The feudal conflict of the Middle Ages heavily affected Utrecht
the Counts of Holland and the Dukes of Guelders
The Veluwe region was seized by Guelders
The most dominant of these was the Cathedral of Saint Martin, inside the old Roman fortress
The construction of the present Gothic building was begun in 1254 after an earlier romanesque construction had been badly damaged by fire
the age of the great cathedrals had come to an end and declining finances prevented the ambitious project from being finished
Besides the cathedral there were four collegiate churches in Utrecht
the city housed St. Paul's Abbey, the 15th-century beguinage of St. Nicholas, and a 14th-century chapter house of the Teutonic Knights.
allowed Utrecht to become an important trade centre in the Northern Netherlands.
Henry V in 1122
the bishop, who controlled many lands outside of the city, and the citizens of Utrecht was not always easy
The bishop, for example dammed the Kromme Rijn at Wijk bij Duurstede to protect his estates from flooding
In 1528 the bishop lost secular power over both Neder- and Oversticht – which included the city of Utrecht – to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor
Charles V combined the Seventeen Provinces (the current Benelux and the northern parts of France) as a personal union
the prince-bishopric Utrecht, as the secular rule was now the lordship of Utrecht, with the religious power remaining with the bishop
In 1559 the bishopric of Utrecht was raised to archbishopric to make it the religious center of the Northern ecclesiastical province in the Seventeen provinces
Charles V was struggling to exert his power over the citizens of the city, who had struggled to gain a certain level of independence from the bishops
The heavily fortified castle Vredenburg was built to house a large garrison whose main task was to maintain control over the city
The castle would last less than 50 years before it was demolished in an uprising in the early stages of the Dutch Revolt
the northern seven provinces signed the Union of Utrecht, in which they decided to join forces against Spanish rule
The Union of Utrecht is seen as the beginning of the Dutch Republic
towards its dominant province Holland
Utrecht remained an atypical city in the new republic with about 40% Catholic in the mid-17th century, and even more among the elite groups
temporarily fell to the French invasion in 1672 (the Disaster Year); where the French invasion was only stopped west of Utrecht
the centre of Utrecht was struck by a tornado
The halt to building before construction of flying buttresses in the 15th century now proved to be the undoing of the central section of the cathedral
In 1713, Utrecht hosted one of the first international peace negotiations when the Treaty of Utrecht settled the War of the Spanish Succession
Utrecht became the centre of the non-Roman Old Catholic Churches in the world
the role of Utrecht as a fortified town had become obsolete
a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened
the Dutch government allowed the bishopric of Utrecht to be reinstated by Rome, and Utrecht became the centre of Dutch Catholicism
New middle class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and Oog in Al, were built
were developed following modernist ideas of the 1960s, in a brutalist style
the shopping mall Hoog Catharijne
In the early 21st century the whole area is being redeveloped
About 38% percent of its population either earns a minimum income or is dependent on social welfare
About 69% of the population is of Dutch ancestry
Kanaleneiland, Overvecht and Hoograven consist primarily of high-rise housing developments, and are known for relatively high poverty and crime rate
which makes concise definitions of its agglomeration difficult, and somewhat arbitrary.
smaller Utrecht agglomeration of continuously built up areas counts some 420,000 inhabitants and includes Nieuwegein, IJsselstein and Maarssen
The larger region, including slightly more remote towns such as Woerden and Amersfoort counts up to 820,000 inhabitants
Utrecht's cityscape is dominated by the Dom Tower, the tallest belfry in the Netherlands and originally part of the Cathedral of Saint Martin
An ongoing debate is over whether any building in or near the centre of town should surpass the Dom Tower in height (112 m)
the Nieuw Galgenwaard stadium (2007)
the old centre and the canal structure in the inner city
The inner city has largely retained its Medieval structure, and the moat ringing the old town is largely intact
Surrounding the medieval core there is a ring of late 19th- and early 20th-century neighbourhoods, with newer neighbourhoods positioned farther out
The eastern part of Utrecht remains fairly open
Utrecht Centraal is the main railway station of Utrecht
Utrecht Centraal is a station on the night service, providing 7 days a week an all night service
International InterCityExpress (ICE) services to Germany (and further) through Arnhem call at Utrecht Centraal
local trains to all areas surrounding Utrecht also depart from Utrecht Centraal; and service several smaller stations
The main local and regional bus station of Utrecht is located adjacent to Utrecht Centraal railway station, at the East and West entrances
large scale renovation and construction works at the railway station, the station's bus stops are changing frequently
Local buses in Utrecht are operated by Qbuzz – its services include a high-frequency service to the Uithof university district
The local bus fleet is one of Europe's cleanest, using only buses compliant with the Euro-VI standard as well as electric buses for inner city transport
Utrecht has an extensive network of cycle paths, making cycling safe and popular. 33% of journeys within the city are by bicycle
There are also barrow bikes, for carrying shopping or small children
in 2014 to build the world's largest bicycle parking station, near the Central Railway Station
well-connected to the Dutch road network. Two of the most important major roads serve the city of Utrecht:
A12 and A2 motorways connect Amsterdam, Arnhem, The Hague and Maastricht, as well as Belgium and Germany
increasing traffic and the ancient city plan, traffic congestion is a common phenomenon in and around Utrecht, causing elevated levels of air pollutants
The economy of Utrecht depends for a large part on the several large institutions located in the city
It is the centre of the Dutch railroad network and the location of the head office of Nederlandse Spoorwegen
Rabobank, a large bank, has its headquarters in Utrecht.
Hoog Catharijne
The corridors are treated as public places like streets, and the route between the station and the city centre is open all night
Parts of the city's network of canals, which were filled to create the shopping center and central station area, will be recreated
The Jaarbeurs, one of the largest convention centres in the Netherlands, is located at the west side of the central railway station
The most prominent of these is Utrecht University (est. 1636), the largest university of the Netherlands with 30,449 students
According to Shanghai Jiaotong University's university ranking in 2014 it is the 57th best university in the world
Utrecht also houses the much smaller University of Humanistic Studies, which houses about 400 students.
Utrecht city has an active cultural life, and in the Netherlands is second only to Amsterdam
Utrecht is host to the international Early Music Festival (Festival Oude Muziek, for music before 1800) and the Netherlands Film Festival
The city has an important classical music hall Vredenburg
Young musicians are educated in the conservatory, a department of the Utrecht School of the Arts
Training of artists is done at the Utrecht School of the Arts
Although street art is illegal in Utrecht
1924 Rietveld Schröder House, which is listed on UNESCO's world heritage sites
To promote culture Utrecht city organizes cultural Sundays
thematic Sunday several organisations create a program, which is open to everyone without, or with a very much reduced, admission fee
an organisation for amateur education in arts aimed at all inhabitants (Utrechts Centrum voor de Kunsten
The city council provides coupons for discounts to inhabitants who receive welfare to be used with many of the initiatives.
Utrecht is home to the premier league (professional) football club FC Utrecht
Utrecht's waterways are used by several rowing clubs
Kampong, the largest (amateur) sportsclub in the Netherlands (4,500 members)
Kampong features fieldhockey, soccer, cricket, tennis, squash and jeu de boules.

Paul Halmos states that "von Neumann's speed was awe-inspiring."
Neumann actually enjoyed thinking, maybe even to the exclusion of everything else.
"fastest mind I ever met",
He was the cleverest man I ever knew, without exception. He was a genius.
Johnny was the only student I was ever afraid of.
One of his remarkable abilities was his power of absolute recall.
he immediately began to recite the first chapter and continued until asked to stop after about ten or fifteen minutes.
von Neumann's way of thinking might not be visual, but more of an aural one.
I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von Neumann's does not indicate a species superior to that of man
he is regarded as one of the giants of modern mathematics

hypothesis of pangenesis.
Darwin's concept of selection working on a population with a range of small variations was workable
in the 1930s and 1940s
Neo Darwinian Evolution
often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found
why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms?
the competition between different forms, combined with the small number of individuals of intermediate forms, often leading to extinction of such forms.
flying squirrels, and flying lemurs
simple eyes found in invertebrates, starting with nothing more than an optic nerve coated with pigment
any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.
He thought it reasonable that species with an extreme dependency on slave workers had evolved in incremental steps.
He suggested that bees that make hexagonal cells evolved in steps from bees that made round cells, under pressure from natural selection to economise wax
some species of slave-making ants were more dependent on slaves than others
in order to preserve separately created species

variability and change in the environment
Richard Owen
Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras
South America, Africa, and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes, but those regions have very different plants and animals
barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions.
His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification.
morphology
the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat
animals of the same class often have extremely similar embryos
e wings of flightless birds and the rudiments of pelvis and leg bones found in some snakes
that his theory might produce revolutionary changes
so as not to prejudice readers against his theory
that psychology would be put on a new foundation and that "Light will be thrown on the origin of man"
to show that species had not been separately created, and to show that natural selection had been the chief agent of change
the concept of transmutation of species
his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism.
the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.
Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines
John Herschel
its existence in nature, its ability to produce the effects of interest, and its ability to explain a wide range of observations
Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics
because the book was an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay
it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation
its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists and could not be dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction.
would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail
no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications
Darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science
social reform
Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms
Darwinism
the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague "law of development" of Vestiges had not found scientific favour
natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible.

as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science
that comparative anatomy and palaeontology could be used to reconstruct evolutionary genealogies
Richard Owen,
bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous "ordained becoming"
Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class

to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of Caucasians over non white races and justify European imperialism
to justify military aggression and unethical business practices
he opposed polygenism, the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry.
strongly opposed to the ideas in the book
interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design
Darwin quoted Kingsley as "a celebrated cleric", and added the phrase "by the Creator" to the closing sentence,
some commentators have taken this as a concession to religion that Darwin later regretted
Darwin's view at the time was of God creating life through the laws of nature
Baden Powell praised "Mr Darwin's masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature"
defending the book in terms of theistic evolution, Natural Selection is not inconsistent with Natural Theology.
Theistic evolution became a popular compromise
supernatural intervention could not be a scientific explanation
by supposing there was some supernatural intervention on the path leading to humans

a list or description of the evidence that the editor used (names of manuscripts, or abbreviations called sigla)
the editor's analysis of that evidence (sometimes a simple likelihood rating)
a record of rejected variants of the text (often in order of preference)

variant readings, or simply variants or readings.
either by accident (duplication or omission) or intention (harmonization or censorship)
document variant readings
so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition.
The collation of all known variants of a text
so that a reader can track how textual decisions have been made in the preparation of a text for publication
Edward Fitzgerald
The Bible and the works of William Shakespeare
an impression of the number of witnesses
a second edition of a Shakespeare play may include an addition alluding to an event known to have happened between the two editions
textual critics may reconstruct the original without the addition.
evidence of each physical witness, its date, source, and relationship to other known witnesses.
Since errors tend to accumulate, older manuscripts should have fewer errors.
geographically diverse
more than one prior copy (exemplar) was consulted in producing the current one
Applying this principle leads to taking the more difficult (unharmonized) reading as being more likely to be the original.
scribes tended to add words, for clarification or out of habit
shorter reading
the tendency for harmonization—resolving apparent inconsistencies in the text.
more difficult reading
They proposed nine critical rules
The reading is less likely to be original that shows a disposition to smooth away difficulties.
"The reading is to be preferred that most fitly explains the existence of the others."
Readings are approved or rejected by reason of the quality, and not the number, of their supporting witnesses
The reading is to be preferred that most fitly explains the existence of the others.
19th century
The citing of sources used, and alternate readings, and the use of original text and images
the depth of research of the critic
justify a result that fits the textual critic's aesthetic or theological agenda
a rigorous approach to textual criticism
The family tree is also referred to as a cladogram.
it may be presumed that they were derived from a common intermediate source

The process of constructing the stemma
examinatio and emendatio
copy text editing
eclecticism
critics tended overwhelmingly to produce trees divided into just two branches.
the method was tending to produce bipartite stemmas regardless of the actual history of the witnesses.
editors tended to favor trees with two branches
this would maximize the opportunities for editorial judgment
the method was not as rigorous or as scientific as its proponents had claimed.
emendatio
the critic employs conjecture at every step of the process
, it may be no more than fortuitous that more witnesses have survived that present a particular reading
1904

inserting into it, from the first edition which contains them, such corrections as appear to us to be derived from the author."
we must accept all the alterations of that edition, saving any which seem obvious blunders or misprints
Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare
the claims of two readings ... appear to be exactly balanced
if there is no reason for altering its reading, the obvious thing seems to be to let it stand.
indifferent
The principle is sound without regard for the literary period.
the manuscript should generally serve as copy-text

John Edwards
This was the first time in U.S. history
All ten electors in the state cast ballots for John Edwards for vice president
under that electoral system only votes for the president's position were cast, with the runner-up in the Electoral College becoming vice president
it violated Electoral College rules
It was clear that the result in Ohio, along with two other states who had still not declared (New Mexico and Iowa), would decide the winner
provisional ballots that had yet to be counted, initially reported to number as high as 200,000
The result of an electoral tie would cause the election to be decided in the House of Representatives with each state casting one vote, regardless of population
the outcome of the election hinged solely on the result in Ohio
Al Gore
a motion was made contesting Ohio's electoral votes
During the debate, no Senator argued that the outcome of the election should be changed by either court challenge or revote
Senator Boxer
Senator Boxer claimed that she had made the motion not to challenge the outcome, but to "shed the light of truth on these irregularities."
Not voting were 52 Republicans and 80 Democrats
"the widespread irregularities make it impossible to know for certain that the [Ohio] outcome reflected the will of the voters."
Howard Dean
the machines were not reliable
the Republicans are willing to do things that are unethical to manipulate elections

Previously, television advertisements only required a written "paid for by" disclaimer on the screen.
ballot initiative in Colorado, known as Amendment 36
under the amendment Colorado would have assigned presidential electors proportionally to the statewide vote count, which would be a unique system

Detractors claimed that this splitting would diminish Colorado's influence in the Electoral College

The taxation needed for war caused the Russian people considerable hardship
being added to the taxation of salt and alcohol begun by Empress Elizabeth in 1759
Like Sweden, Russia concluded a separate peace with Prussia.
Great Britain, which gained the bulk of New France in North America, Spanish Florida
some individual Caribbean islands in the West Indies,
the colony of Senegal on the West African coast
France was deprived of many of its colonies
had saddled itself with heavy war debts that its inefficient financial system could barely handle
The war has been described as the first "world war"
The term "Second Hundred Years' War" has been used in order to describe the almost continuous level of world-wide conflict during the entire 18th century,
reminiscent of the more famous and compact struggle of the 14th century
to later conflicts like the Napoleonic Wars

good luck and successful strategy
King Frederick the Great
Great Britain and Austria, had coalesced
British military effort had not saved Silesia for Austria
British subsidies to Austria had produced nothing of much help to the British
The collapse of that system and the aligning of France with Austria and of Great Britain with Prussia constituted what is known as the “diplomatic revolution”
. Prussia, having secured Silesia, had come to terms with Austria
June 2, 1746, Austria and Russia concluded a defensive alliance that covered their own territory and Poland against attack by Prussia or the Ottoman Empire
They also agreed to a secret clause that promised the restoration of Silesia and the countship of Glatz (now Kłodzko, Poland) to Austria
the countship of Glatz (now Kłodzko, Poland) to Austria
Their real desire, however, was to destroy Frederick’s power altogether

that the inner and outer doors were closed before the elevator was allowed to move
a passenger registers their floor calls before entering the car
the computer distributes adjacent stops to different cars in the bank
travel time is reduced as the elevator makes fewer stops for individual passengers
passenger waiting times may be longer as they will not necessarily be allocated the next car to depart
the system is subject to gaming
The dispatching algorithm
people believe this to be an effective way to hurry elevators
this will make the computer think multiple people are waiting and will allocate empty cars to serve this one person
every user gets an RFID card to identify himself
the system knows every user call and can cancel the first call if the passenger decides to travel to another destination to prevent empty calls
either for the purposes of evacuating the building or for security reasons
moderate incoming traffic
most typically in the morning
people arrive for work or at the conclusion of a lunch-time period
when they reach a pre-determined passenger load, or when they have had their doors opened for a certain period of time
to encourage passengers to make maximum use of the available elevator system capacity

to provide access to the hoistway and car top for inspection and maintenance
a key switch on the car operating panel usually labeled 'Inspection', 'Car Top', 'Access Enable' or 'HWENAB
the elevator will come to a stop if moving
The elevator can now only be moved by the corresponding 'Access' key switches
a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building
The elevator will wait an amount of time, then proceed to go into nudging mode to tell everyone the elevator is leaving the floor
the elevator will go to the fire-recall floor
The only way to return the elevator to normal service is to switch it to bypass after the alarms have reset
the elevator will have an alternate floor to recall to
Phase-two mode can only be activated by a key switch located inside the elevator on the centralized control panel
manually pushes and holds the door close button
enables the car to move
This mode was created for firefighters so that they may rescue people from a burning building
on the COP
it will park with its doors open and the car buttons will be disabled to prevent a passenger from taking control of the elevator
Medical personnel must then activate the code-blue key switch inside the car, select their floor and close the doors with the door close button
The elevator will then travel non-stop to the selected floor
will remain in code-blue service until switched off in the car
allows the elevator to remain at a floor locked out of service until code blue is deactivated
One by one, each car in the group will return to the lobby floor, open its doors and shut down
People in the remaining elevators may see an indicator light or hear a voice announcement informing them that the elevator will return to the lobby shortly
the system will then automatically select one or more cars to be used for normal operations and these cars will return to service
The car(s) selected to run under emergency power can be manually overridden by a key or strip switch in the lobby
when the system detects that it is running low on power, it will bring the running cars to the lobby or nearest floor, open the doors and shut down
emergency power will lower the elevators to the lowest landing and open the doors to allow passengers to exit
The doors then close after an adjustable time period and the car remains unusable until reset, usually by cycling the elevator main power switch
due to the high current draw when starting the pump motor

There are 45 million Hispanophones who speak Spanish as a first or second language in the United States,
Roughly half of all American Spanish-speakers also speak English "very well," based on their self-assessment in the U.S. Census.

In 1846, the Republic dissolved when Texas entered the United States of America as a state.
Per the 1850 U.S. census, fewer than 16,000 Texans were of Mexican descent, and nearly all were Spanish-speaking people
California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, western Colorado and southwestern Wyoming became part of the Mexican territory of Alta California
After the Mexican War of Independence from Spain
most of New Mexico, western Texas, southern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, and Oklahoma panhandle were part of the territory of Santa Fe de Nuevo México
The geographical isolation and unique political history of this territory
Through the force of sheer numbers, the English-speaking American settlers entering the Southwest established their language, culture, and law
United States never developed bilingualism as Canada did.
California constitutional convention of 1849 had eight Californio participants; the resulting state constitution was produced in English and Spanish,
the convention's English-speaking participants felt that the state's remaining minority of Spanish-speakers should simply learn English
the convention ultimately voted 46-39 to revise the earlier clause so that all official proceedings would henceforth be published only in English.
U.S. federal government strenuously tried to force Puerto Ricans to adopt English
making them use English as the primary language of instruction in their high schools.
It was completely unsuccessful,
the territory was never hit with a massive influx of millions of English speakers like the vast territory acquired from Mexico 50 years earlier.
Puerto Rico was able to maintain its Spanish language, culture, and identity because the relatively small, densely populated island

Puerto Ricans are the least likely to be proficient in Spanish
7.0 per cent of the islands' people are either Hispanic or Hispanophone or both.
many Puerto Ricans have migrated to New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, and other areas of the Eastern United States
Immigration to the United States of Spanish-speaking Cubans began because of Cuba's political instability
The deposition of Fulgencio Batista's dictatorship and the ascension of Fidel Castro's government in 1959 increased Cuban immigration to the United States

the economic collapse of the country many more Nicaraguans migrated to the United States amongst other countries.
The exodus of Salvadorans was a result of both economic and political problems.
The largest immigration wave occurred as a result of the Salvadoran Civil War in the 1980s
20–30% of El Salvador's population emigrated. About 50%, or up to 500,000 of those who escaped headed to the United States,
United States, which was already home to over 10,000 Salvadorans, making Salvadorans Americans the fourth-largest Hispanic and Latino American group
Salvadorans Americans the fourth-largest Hispanic and Latino American group, after the Mexican-American majority, stateside Puerto Ricans, and Cubans.
civil wars engulfed several Central American countries in the 1980s
Salvadorans fled their country and came to the United States. Between 1980 and 1990
the Salvadoran immigrant population in the United States increased nearly fivefold from 94,000 to 465,000.
the United States continued to grow in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of family reunification and new arrivals fleeing a series of natural disasters
By 2008, there were about 1.1 million Salvadoran immigrants in the United States.
Until the 20th century, there was no clear record of the number of Venezuelans who emigrated to the United States.
Between the 18th and early 19th centuries, there were many European immigrants who went to Venezuela
Many Venezuelans settled in the United States with hopes of receiving a better education, only to remain in there following graduation.
since the early 1980s, the reasons for Venezuelan emigration have changed to include hopes of earning a higher salary
In the 2000s, more Venezuelans opposing the economic and political policies of president Hugo Chávez migrated to the United States
mostly to Florida, but New York City and Houston are other destinations). The largest concentration of Venezuelans in the United States is in South Florida
New York, California, Texas (adding their existing Hispanic populations), New Jersey, Massachusetts and Maryland.
Some of the urban areas with a high Venezuelan community include Miami, New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C.
Some states, such as New Mexico, provide bilingual legislated notices and official documents
there was a trend that most Americans and American residents who are of Hispanic descent speak only English in the home.
English is the dominant language of business, education, government, religion, media, culture, civil society, and the public sphere.
United States has no de jure official language, English is the dominant language
The state (like its southwestern neighbors) has had close linguistic and cultural ties with Mexico
The state outside the Gadsden Purchase of 1853 was part of the New Mexico Territory until 1863, when the western half was made into the Arizona Territory.
The area of the former Gadsden Purchase contained a majority of Spanish-speakers until the 1940s
the continuous arrival of Mexican settlers increases the number of Spanish-speakers.
the state has no official language.
New Mexico's laws are promulgated bilingually in Spanish and English.
Spanish has been spoken in the New Mexico-Colorado border and the contemporary U.S.–Mexico border since the 16th century
New Mexico is commonly thought to have Spanish as an official language alongside English because of its wide usage and legal promotion of Spanish in the state
Because of its relative isolation from other Spanish-speaking areas over most of its 400-year existence
, New Mexico Spanish, and in particular the Spanish of northern New Mexico and Colorado has retained many elements of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish
has developed its own vocabulary. In addition, it contains many words from Nahuatl, the language spoken by the ancient Aztecs of Mexico.
New Mexican Spanish also contains loan words from the Pueblo languages of the upper Rio Grande Valley, Mexican-Spanish words (mexicanismos)
borrowings from English. Grammatical changes include the loss of the second person verb form, changes in verb endings
In Texas, English is the state's de facto official language

websites in Spanish to assist residents who have limited English proficiency.
Spanish is currently the most widely taught non-English language
More than 1.4 million university students were enrolled in language courses
Spanish is the most widely taught language in American colleges and universities with 53 percent of the total number of people enrolled

Calvin Veltman undertook, for the National Center for Education Statistics and for the Hispanic Policy Development Project
the most complete study of English language adoption by Hispanophone immigrants
his study based itself upon a large 1976 sample from the Bureau of the Census (which has not been repeated),
data from the 1990 Census tend to confirm the great Anglicization of the US Hispanic American origin population.

The Premier League is a corporation in which the 20 member clubs act as shareholders
Teams play 38 matches each (playing each team in the league twice, home and away), totalling 380 matches in the season.
Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons; others during weekday evenings
It is currently sponsored by Barclays Bank and thus officially known as the Barclays Premier League and is colloquially known as the Premiership.
Outside the UK it is commonly referred to as the English Premier League (EPL).

The Council of Trent
doctrine of the immaculate conception (Mary being conceived free from original sin) is not to be confused with her virginal conception of her son Jesus
Catholics believe that Mary was not the product of a virginal conception herself but was the daughter of a human father and mother
since the 4th century
1677, the Holy See condemned the belief that Mary was virginally conceived,
Saint Joachim and Saint Anne
dogma in Ineffabilis Deus, Pope Pius IX explicitly affirmed that Mary was redeemed in a manner more sublime
Another misunderstanding is that, by her immaculate conception, Mary did not need a saviour
Catholic Church has taught that even had man never sinned in the Garden of Eden and was sinless, he would still require God's grace to remain sinless.

the feast of her conception was widely celebrated in the Byzantine East

In the West it was known as the feast of the Conception (passive) of Mary, and was associated particularly with the Normans
Critics included Saints Bernard of Clairvaux, Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas.

Proposing a solution to the theological problem of reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ
immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ;

Mariology
Martin Luther
Protestant Reformation
Mother Mary, like us, was born in sin of sinful parents, but the Holy Spirit covered her, sanctified and purified her
this child was born of flesh and blood, but not with sinful flesh and blood.
Some Lutherans, such as the members of the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church, support the doctrine.

The report "Mary: Faith and Hope in Christ"
Assumption and the Immaculate Conception can be said to be consonant with the teaching of the Scriptures and the ancient common traditions.
The question arises for Anglicans, however, as to whether these doctrines concerning Mary are revealed by God in a way which must be held

every person that comes into the world, is touched at his birth by the devil, and therefore cries out,
passage in the Qur'an, "I have called her Mary; and I commend her to thy protection, and also her issue, against Satan driven away with stones
Others have rejected that the doctrine of Immaculate Conception exists in Islam
in Islam every human child is born pure and immaculate
her sinless birth is thus independent of the Christian docrtrine of original sin as no such doctrine exists in Islam
Muslim tradition or hadith, which states that the only children born without the "touch of Satan," were Mary and Jesus.
